# Conducting Data Analysis for Machine Learning

## Overview
We will explore the structure, content, and best practices for writing the data analysis chapter in a research project, with a focus on machine learning.

We will:
- Review a prior anonymized student submission.
- Discuss how to structure a Data Analysis chapter.
- Compare different approaches (single model, multiple model comparison, optimization, applying ML to survey or qualitative data).
- Planning individual Data Analysis chapters.  

Disclaimer: Your supervisor's decision and guidance supercedes mine. Always consult with them as I do not know your study as well as they do.

## Discussion Points
* A Data Analysis chapter should **show rigor, transparency, and alignment** with research questions.  
* Whether comparing models, optimizing one model, or applying ML to different data types, the structure follows somewhat similar logic:  
  1. Describe data.  
  2. Justify model choice.  
  3. Explain training and evaluation.  
  4. Report and interpret results.  
  5. Link back to research objectives.  


## Activity: Planning Your Data Analysis Section

Produce a short outline (one page) that includes:
1. Type of data your study uses (numeric, survey, text, etc.)  
2. Planned ML model(s) and justification.  
3. EDA/Preprocessing steps needed.  
4. Training/validation approach (train-test split, cross-validation, pipelines etc.).  
5. Evaluation metrics to be used.
6. Hypertuning your model and optimization.  
7. Presenting your comparison.
8. Linking back to the research question(s).  

Guidelines:
- Use the eight-point framework outlined above.  
- Ensure that each step is always linked back to your research questions.  
- Be specific about model choice and evaluation metrics. Now is time to be specific.
